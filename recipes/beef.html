<h2>Braised Beef</h2>
<!-- this is recipe 2 --> 
 <!-- how are you  -->
<p><strong> An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread. </strong>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid. </p>
